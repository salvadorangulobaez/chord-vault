## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.9.2 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.9.2 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cancionero
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

4. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-specific Setup

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Add Flutter to PATH if not already done
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\salvi\flutter\bin"
```

#### Android
- Ensure Android SDK is installed
- Enable USB debugging for physical devices
- Or use Android emulator

#### iOS (macOS only)
- Xcode and iOS SDK required
- iOS Simulator or physical device

## 🎼 Data Models

### Song Model
```dart
class Song {
  final String id;
  String title;
  final List<Block> blocks;
  final String? originalKey;
  final List<String> tags;
  final String? author;
  bool isFavorite;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime updatedAt;
}
```

### Block Model
```dart
class Block {
  final String id;
  String content;
  final BlockType type;
  int transposition;
  // ... other properties
}
```

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### State Management
- Uses **Riverpod** for state management
- Providers are defined in `lib/providers/app_providers.dart`
- Follow the provider pattern for data access

### Database Operations
- **Hive** is used for local storage
- Models have corresponding adapters for serialization
- Database initialization in `lib/services/storage/hive_service.dart`

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Material 3** design system
- Dark theme by default
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Consistent navigation patterns

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Group related functionality
- **Service layer**: Business logic separated from UI
- **Model layer**: Data structures with Hive adapters
- **Provider layer**: State management and data access

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:
- **Unit tests**: Business logic and utilities
- **Widget tests**: UI component testing
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end functionality

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Input** → UI Components
2. **UI Events** → Riverpod Providers
3. **Providers** → Service Layer
4. **Services** → Hive Database
5. **Database** → Model Updates
6. **Model Changes** → UI Rebuild

## 🎵 Key User Flows

2. Enter song title and metadata
3. Add blocks (verses, chorus, bridge)
4. Add chords and lyrics
5. Save to library

### Transposing
1. Select song from library
2. Choose block to edit
3. Use transposition controls (-, +, Reset)
4. Preview changes in real-time
5. Apply changes permanently

### Library Management
1. Browse songs in library
2. Use search to find specific songs
3. Filter by tags, author, or favorites
4. Edit, delete, or share songs

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flutter not found**
   - Ensure Flutter is in your PATH
   - Run `flutter doctor` to check setup

2. **Build failures**
   - Clean build: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
   - Check dependencies: `flutter pub deps`

3. **Database issues**
   - Clear app data and restart
   - Check Hive initialization

4. **Platform-specific issues**
   - Android: Check SDK version and permissions

**Note for AI Assistants**: This project uses Flutter with Riverpod for state management, Hive for local storage, and follows Material 3 design principles. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers. When making changes, ensure compatibility with the existing architecture and maintain the established patterns.
